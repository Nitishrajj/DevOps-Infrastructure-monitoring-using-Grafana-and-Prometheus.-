# DevOps-Infrastructure-monitoring-using-Grafana-and-Prometheus.-

This project centers around establishing a robust and comprehensive infrastructure monitoring system using Grafana and Prometheus within a DevOps environment. The primary focus is on monitoring the nodes within the infrastructure to ensure optimal performance, identify potential issues, and facilitate timely responses to maintain system health.
Also the project places a particular emphasis on monitoring individual nodes within the infrastructure. Metrics related to CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network activity, and other node-specific indicators are collected and visualized.

# Getting started 
Tools used 
Grafana -- 
Grafana serves as the visualization and dashboarding platform, providing an intuitive and customizable interface for monitoring and analyzing data.
Dashboards are crafted to offer a real-time, consolidated view of critical metrics, empowering DevOps teams to make informed decisions promptly.

Prometheus -- 
Prometheus acts as the core monitoring and alerting component, responsible for collecting and storing time-series data from various nodes in the infrastructure.
Customizable Prometheus queries enable the extraction of relevant metrics, empowering operators to gain insights into resource utilization, system performance, and potential bottlenecks.
